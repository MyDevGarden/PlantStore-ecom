            shipment . If the express shipment is not available for the
            destination pin code the standard shipping is used. The date of
            delivery mentioned or communicated to you is an estimate. Since our
            products are shipped using the services of our courier partners, the
            delivery date may vary. Orders are dispatched within 48hrs or as per
            the delivery date agreed at the time of order confirmation and
            delivering of the shipment subject to courier company/post office
            norms. Your order may be delivered earlier or after the chosen date

            will be present to receive the package at the given address. Our
            courier partners make three attempts and if not received then
            initiate the RTO(Return to Origin). In that case we are not
            responsible and no refund will be initiated. The delivery address
            cannot be changed after an order is dispatched. All courier orders
            are carefully packed and shipped from our warehouse. In case of
            plants, the actual product delivered may vary in size and foliage
            compared to whatâ€™s shown on the product. Since flowering plants are
            seasonal, actual plant may be delivered without flowers. DELIVERY
